### Project Description

This project demonstrates a web scraping solution designed to fetch and analyze articles from **El Pa√≠s**, a popular Spanish news outlet. The solution ensures that the website's text is displayed in Spanish and scrapes articles from the "Opinion" section. The first five articles are extracted, including their titles and content in Spanish. If available, the cover images of these articles are downloaded and saved,you can view them in the article_images folder. The article titles are then translated into English using the **Google Translate API**, and the translated headers are analyzed to identify words repeated more than twice across all headers, with the counts printed for reference. The solution has been thoroughly tested locally and successfully executed on **BrowserStack** across multiple threads, ensuring compatibility across a combination of browsers for cross-browser testing. This comprehensive approach highlights efficient web scraping, translation integration, and cross-platform compatibility.
